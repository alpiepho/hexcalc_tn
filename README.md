# hexcalc_tn

Goal:<br>
semi-duplicate hexcalc from [cp hexcalc](https://www.fileviewer.com/cphexcalc/), then modify for RPN (reverse polish notation) and other features I want.

Also want this to be a PWA.



- copy/munge lib/components from scoreboard_tn
- copy/munge lib/consts
- copy/munge lig/engine
- update main.dart

- duplicate main screen
- duplicate setting screen
- basic engine with math
