## hexcalc_tn


Goal:<br>
semi-duplicate hexcalc from [cp hexcalc](https://www.fileviewer.com/cphexcalc/), 
then modify for RPN (reverse polish notation) and other features I want.

My intent is to practice with Flutter, not steal a design.  This will not be offered as a product.

Also want this to be a PWA.
